Since Citadel has to updated with very low frequency say 6 time an year so changing contents on update isn't a real problem for feasible operation and can be ignored for practical reason as a parameter to determine the method of operation.Storing already prepared zip files cost approxomately twice the space already required space which is not a huge task to account for but we are not utilizing our computational efficeny to save up memory. A more optimum solution would be to have a space limitation beyond which pre stored zip files will be available also if current stats of how frequently resources are accounted for can be parameter for which courses require pre stored zip files as per popularity and size.
